<h2>About Me</h2>

<img id="main-pic" src= "assets/image/IMG_0409.JPG" alt="Profile Picture">

<p>I was born and raised in the great state of New Jersey. After studying political science at West Chester Univeristy in Pa I launched a career in sales and marketing. Eventually my work took me to the greatest city on earth, NYC. After spending 5 years in NYC working for a number of tech start-ups I moved back to NJ to raise my beautiful daughter Emma.
<br><br>

My years working for tech companies along with my natural curiosity led me to web development. Making the transition from sales and marketing into coding hasn't also been the easiest, but with a little hard work things are starting to come together.
